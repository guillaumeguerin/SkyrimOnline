This is an attempt to convert the Skyrim Online code to C#. 
Started because the Java system in the SO server is unneccesary
and causes build issues

May end up making a base entity class which includes;

Vector3 _position, _rotation

Which could make things tidier, though performance impact of inheritance is unknown
